| November 12 |  8:30-9:30pm  |                                                                                                              I used binary codes for the nucleotides to save data more succinctly. I then write it out after, but it doesn't work. I'll ask you more tomorrow. |

| November 14 |  10-10:30pm   |  I also used class time, but to no avail, and no changes were made so I didn't add it here. I ended up improving a little by having arrays for char to val maps and vice versa but I needed to create them inside the functions to avoid dealing with statics. |
